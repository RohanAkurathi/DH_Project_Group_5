        <h3>Data Overview</h3>
        <p>The information that is included is mainly the number of deportations from the United States in the period from 1892 to 1921. Additionally, the dataset provides more information, such as the ethnicities and nationalities of the people who were deported. The locational data includes what state and city each person was deported from, and what country they were deported to. The reasoning for why each person was deported is also included, which ranges from disease to some people committing crimes. One piece of information that might be interesting to look into is people being deported for being considered an “idiot/imbecile.” We are unsure as to what this constitutes, as it seems like a very subjective reason to deport someone. Another thing that this data reveals is that a large number of Germans and Italians were deported, despite the Chinese Exclusion Act being in place. It appears as though these populations were heavily targeted. Overall, this data provides a lot of background information that will help guide us as we conduct our research and helps reveal what communities may have been targeted.</p>

        <h3>What Information Is Included & What This Dataset Can Illuminate — Dylan</h3>
        <p>Although this data reveals much valuable information regarding all forty thousand plus deportations in America from 1893–1921, it does not reveal the personal stories of the people listed, as well as the contexts that they were deported under. Political pressure, racial problems, or economic hardship could all be reasons why these decisions were made. It also lacks contextual information regarding what the United States' deportation policy was like at the time, as well as what leaders were in power that may have influenced an influx of deportations. It also does not represent the human aspect at all, and what effect these displacements have had on the families and their lives. This is the main problem with quantitative data, as it lacks context that explains the deeper political, social, and racial implications of what affected these numbers.</p>

        <h3>How the Data Was Generated & Origins & Funding — Kenny</h3>
        <p>The data is generated onto a sheet. Most of the data centers on the port of deportation, the grounds for deportation, and the destination of deportation. Some columns will also depict exact longitude and latitudes for where the deportation took place. The source itself was found through the Harvard Dataverse Website. However, the author of the dataset is Torrie Hester, a history professor at Saint Louis University. She seems to be very involved with educating about deportation, and this dataset was made for “Deportations from the United States: A Visual History” (DVH) (2020-11-10). This data was published on November 23rd, 2021; however, it was added to the repository on November 10th, 2020. There is no public confirmation on who funded this data.</p>

        <h3>What Information Is Left Out — Yuexi</h3>
        <p>A lot of information is left out about this dataset. Firstly, this dataset is sourced from the Harvard Dataverse website, which is accessible on Canvas. Although the website has the metadata section, this only describes the general contexts of the dataset. It does not explain the meaning of the categories and values of the dataset.</p>
        <p>Secondly, this dataset contains numerous blank spaces, mostly in the DeportedFromLat, DeportedFromLong, DeportedTo, DeportedToName, and DeportedToiso_alpha categories. These data provide information on the port of deportation and the destination of deportation, which is important for understanding deportation routes and patterns. Some data in NatandracName and Natandraciso_alpha are also missing, but compared to the amount of missing data in the DeportedFrom… categories, it's just a small amount.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, the dataset does not provide any personal information about the deported people. For example, there is no information on their family backgrounds, education levels, or economic status etc. These individual circumstances are essential clues for the reason for deportation and the deportation patterns. Lastly, the reason for this missing data is not explicit.</p>

        <h3>What the Dataset Cannot Reveal — Rohan</h3>
        <p>This dataset has a few things that cannot be found from the pure numbers. We are able to see limited information lacking sufficient context. We are unable to see beyond the basic and learn more about the individual and their personal experience—issues like why they were deported. The data also does not provide information on what entity or enforcement assisted or initiated the deportation, for example ICE or any other agency. We are also unaware of a great deal of information such as how many deportations weren’t present or misclassified. The data also lacks descriptions on the laws and regulations at the time.</p>

        <h3>Ideological Effects — Yitian</h3>
        <p>The dataset shows certain ideological effects in how deportation data was recorded and presented. It treats people mainly as numbers and cases instead of individuals with personal stories. This reflects how the U.S. government at that time viewed deportation—as an administrative or legal issue rather than a human one. The way the data is organized also suggests a belief that the process was neutral and objective, but in reality, it was influenced by politics, racism, and economic interests.</p>
        <p>Another ideological effect comes from who created the data. Since it was collected by government officials, it only shows one side—the state’s perspective—and not the voices of the people who were deported. This imbalance shows how data can reflect the power structure of its time. In short, the dataset not only documents deportations but also carries the ideas and values of authority and control that shaped U.S. immigration policy back then.</p>
